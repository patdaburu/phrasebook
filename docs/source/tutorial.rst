Tutorial
========

`phrasebook` is designed to make it relatively simple for you to place files containing string
templates alongside your python modules.  You have a few different options for doing so: You can
place all your strings in a :ref:`single file <tutorial_single_file>` or you can break them out into
:ref:`multiple files within a directory <tutorial_directory>`.  While we've tried to use simple
naming conventions to minimize the boiler plate for creating a
:ref:`single phrasebook for a module <tutorial_single_file>`, you can also create as many
phrasebooks as you need by :ref:`specifying the path <tutorial_specify_path>` for each one.
